####Lab 1: Visual Digits Recognition 
The main purpose of this exercise is to build an automatic visual
recognition system of hand-written digits from 0 to 9.

####Lab 2: Spoken-Digits Recognition
In this exercise we experimented on a typical digit recognition system from
 speech data provided by the laboratory exercise files. We do not provide
  the data for this task.
 
####Lab 3:  Music Genre Classification and Emotion Recognition
In this exercise we experimented with deep learning architectures for
 implementing music genre classification and emotion recognition. Our
  provided solution in step 12, was ranked 2nd in the [corresponding](https://www.kaggle.com/c/multitask-music-classification/leaderboard) Kaggle
   competition. We should also note that we do not provide the training and testing data.
